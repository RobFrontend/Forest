            <h3>A forest is much more than a plantation</h3>
            <p>To fully understand the difference between a plantation and a forest, one can think of the tropics. Since that is where most plantations can be found, in the lands of the hot climate zones. They are quiet; birds have nothing to look for there, due to the fact that the amount of pesticides used effectively eradicates everything worth eating. Often fenced, endless plantations of cotton, the rubber tree, or the eucalyptus, despite looking quite picturesque on photographs, are, in fact, green deserts. This term, created in Brazil in the late 60s, describes vast, monocultural plantations of trees meant for production and planted in the areas where a primeval forest had previously been stubbed up. The consequences of such undertakings are not only catastrophic damages to the environment but also the harm of different nature, such as resettlements of local populations. The areas of plantations are more prone to fires and droughts. They also pose a risk of introducing invasive species, dangerous to the local environment.</p>
            <h3>The return of the lynx</h3>
            <p>Who would dare to introduce Eurasian lynx into such an environment? Should everything we knew about this species be considered spurious?
It was thought that it prefers terrain with dense undergrowth, lots of deadwood and is afraid of all roads, even forest ones. But this secretive feline
has not yet let itself be truly known.</p>

       <h2>Forest in the Mountains</p>
        <div class='center-text'>
         <h3>The foresters have long seen the problem</h3>
         <p class='p'>A general consequence of climate change would be for some tree species moving northwards. It is expected that many insects would want to accompany their hosts in this quest for a new life. It is also possible that alien species organisms will appear by having been dragged ‘on the occasion of’ international circulation of plant material, wood imports, or even lively tourist traffic. When introduced into new areas, they can cause serious economic losses and also threaten native species.</p>
         <h3>Three parts of a braid</h3>
         <p class='p'>Commercial forests are thus a compromise between a primeval forest and a plantation. A compromise that is necessary, due to the men's demand for timber and its 30 000 ways of use. Skillful utilization of natural resources allows one to have one's cake and eat it – achieve the commercial goal while maintaining all possible natural values of a forest and simultaneously almost incessantly allowing access to the people visiting it, so that it keeps up its social functions.
The fact that the time one has to wait for the result in the form of timber is much longer than it is when it comes to plantations, is compensated by other functions which the forest performs. As a renowned ornithologist, Dr. Andrzej Kruszewicz said, those functions are like a braid – they are made up of three, inseparably connected elements.</p>
          <h3>Have one's cake and eat it</h3>
          <p class='p'>Conclusion? Let us return to the initial considerations. The aim of the plantation cultivations is clearly defined and explicit. It can be compared to a warehouse with one type of product, arranged on the shelves. What the eucalyptus, poplar, or hemp plantations have in common – apart from their production aim – is their appearance. Due to the plants growing in even interspaces, clearing of competitive species, and frequent fallowing (the so-called "bare fallow", where no plants are left) they all look alike. </p>
